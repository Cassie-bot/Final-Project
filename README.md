# Final-Project
Hello, welcome to my game. This game is called “My Unknown Life” and some background about the storyline comes from some 
horror/action films. My game is mainly about a person (The player) that falls in a ditch and wakes up by the woods. The player 
loses its memory and is searching for its family. Its now up to the player to get through the obstacles to find the family. In 
order to play you must use Python, which is where it’s hosted. Recommended technology to have would be Windows or Mac OS. 
Luckily for you there are no system requirements would be anything compatible to download Python (ex: Windows), and as far as 
supported applications to download and/or installation Python would be Chrome, Safari, or etc. There isn’t really a strict 
place you can only download it from. As long as you can access Google to get you to the Python download, then you got it. 
Once you open the program you can see that the coding is displayed in “Modules” from 1 through 5. In order to run the program 
all, you must do is make sure you’re opening the file on IDLE. Then start with “Module 1” and run it to start the game. After 
completing the first module you can then select the following module going in numerical order from 1 through 5. The 
Architecture of the program is mainly using while loops, for loops, if/else statements, repeated code, user input checks, 
using random, and a few more. I hope you enjoy the game!
